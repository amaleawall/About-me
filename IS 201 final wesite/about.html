  <div class="container mt-5">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Amalea Wall, and I am currently a student at Brigham Young University. 
       I love learning and discovering new things, especially when it comes to people,
       cultures, and the world around me. Education has always been important to me, and 
       I enjoy exploring big ideas, asking questions, and finding meaning in the experiences I have.</p>

    <h2>Travel and Cultural Experiences</h2>
    <p>I’ve been lucky enough to travel to many countries and nearly every state in the U.S., and those 
       experiences have shaped who I am. Each place I visit teaches me something new. I love learning about different cultures
       and finding the things that connect us as people. Whether it’s trying new foods, talking to locals, or observing traditions,
       I’m always fascinated by the ways our differences make the world more beautiful.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I lived in seven different states, which taught me early on how to adapt, make connections, and appreciate new environments.
       Moving around so much helped me become open-minded and flexible, and it gave me a deep appreciation for the diversity of communities 
       across the country.</p>

    <h2>My Passion for Business</h2>
    <p>Alongside my love for travel and culture, I’ve developed a strong passion for business and entrepreneurship. I enjoy understanding 
       how people think, what motivates them, and how products or ideas can genuinely make life better. Growing up moving from state to state exposed 
       me to many different communities and opportunities, and it helped me recognize how creativity, communication, and innovation can shape the world around us.</p>

    <p>I love exploring marketing, branding, and social media strategy, and I’m especially drawn to the creative side of business—building
       something from nothing, solving problems, and finding unique ways to connect with an audience. Whether I’m helping manage social media, 
       brainstorming new product ideas, or learning about different markets, I’m always excited by the challenge of growing something meaningful.
       My goal is to combine my global perspective with my business knowledge to create projects that inspire, bring value, and make a positive
       impact.</p>
